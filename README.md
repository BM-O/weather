# Weather App with Animation

## Goals

Create weather application with animated background along with weather data.
When you first visit, your browser will prompt for persmission to access the current browser location, so that the site can fetch weather data for that location.
If you choose not to share browser location, you can enter city and fetch weather data.

Once you choose the location, the site will display current weather, 7 day forecast and a relevant animation in the background.
